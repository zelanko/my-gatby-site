# My personal website

Under development

## But where can we see it?

I'll post a link soon.

## How is it built?

I am using [gatsbyjs](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) which uses [reactjs](https://github.com/facebook/react) heavily.

I played around a bunch with building a [docker](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce) image to do development. And I got it working! It's my first dockerfile. I'm very proud.
